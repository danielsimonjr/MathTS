# @danielsimonjr/mathts-typed-function

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a13ce7e: The published `.d.ts` files now carry explicit `.js` extensions on relative imports, so a consumer on `moduleResolution` `node16` or `nodenext` can use them.
  
  Declaration emit runs under `module`/`moduleResolution` `nodenext` (`tsconfig.dts.base.json`). `tsc` copies a relative specifier into the `.d.ts` verbatim and synthesises one for an inferred type, so the emit mode is what decides whether the extension is there. An extensionless relative import in `src` is now a build error instead of a silent consumer break. A NodeNext consumer type check of the packed tarballs reported 60 errors before this change (53 TS2834, 7 TS2709) and reports 0 after it.
  
  `@danielsimonjr/mathts-functions` also imports `Decimal` and `Complex` as named exports of `decimal.js` and `complex.js`. NodeNext resolves those two packages as CommonJS, where the default export is a namespace and not usable as a type (TS2709).

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 8473590: Declare `typed-function` and `workerpool` as registry `npm:` aliases (`npm:@danielsimonjr/typed-function@5.0.0-alpha.4`, `npm:@danielsimonjr/workerpool@10.2.1`) instead of `github:` git dependencies. npm 10 (bundled with Node 20 and 22) failed to install these packages with "git dep preparation failed ... Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')". The registry builds are code-identical to the git HEADs that were resolved before, and the import names do not change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 57c8ffd: Type tests also accept objects that carry the library's Symbol type marker, so values from a second copy of a package are recognised.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e771b4e: Fix all pre-existing build, typecheck, and configuration issues across the monorepo.

  ### assembly/ (WASM)
  - Fix AssemblyScript build: prefix 114 bare math calls with `Math.`, fix abort path in asconfig.json
